From the time I was introduced to a Commodore 64 I instantly fell in love with software development. I think we are living in the golden age of software development. We have access to a seemlingly limitless knowledge base on the Internet and our tools are evolving at light speed. My passions right now are .NET Core/C# and Blazor. I'm also a huge fan of TypeScript and React. 

I'm looking to take my content creation to the next level by either streaming, creating videos or blogging about open source. I'm leaning on streaming but am still trying to decide what is right for me.

I wrote a simple [Electron + Express](https://github.com/frankhale/electron-with-express) app that got over 400 stars. I'm still shocked by that!

My favorite app right now is [Toby-Blazor](https://github.com/frankhale/toby-blazor) which is a YouTube player which stores your favorite videos. I'm often tweaking it. I've recently been working on [Toby-Angular](https://github.com/frankhale/toby-angular) where I'm refactoring the Toby-Blazor .NET Core data layer and developing an Angular front end (still early on). The refactored data layer will make it's way back into Toby-Blazor at some point.
