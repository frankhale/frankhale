From the time I was introduced to a Commodore 64 I instantly fell in love with software development. I think we are living in the golden age of software development. We have access to a seemlingly limitless knowledge base on the Internet and our tools are evolving at light speed. My passions right now are .NET Core/C# and Blazor. I'm also a huge fan of TypeScript and React.

I wrote a simple [Electron + Express](https://github.com/frankhale/electron-with-express) app that got over 400 stars. I'm still shocked by that!
