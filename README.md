### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

From the time I was introduced to a Commodore 64 I instantly fell in love with
software development. I think we are living in the golden age of software
development. We have access to a seemlingly limitless knowledge base on the
Internet and our tools are evolving at light speed. My passions right now is
.NET/C# and Blazor. I'm also a huge fan of TypeScript and React and Node.

I wrote a simple app called [Electron + Express](https://github.com/frankhale/electron-with-express) that got over 400 stars. I'm still shocked by that!

I'm really interested in game development and am trying my hand at it. I've got
a lot to learn!!!
